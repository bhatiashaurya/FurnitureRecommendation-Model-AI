## ⚠️ Important Notes

### If Backend Shows Authentication Page:
Your backend URL might need to be public. Check:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your backend project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Ensure no authentication is required for API endpoints

### If Frontend Can't Connect to Backend:
1. Check browser console for CORS errors
2. Verify backend allows your frontend domain in CORS settings
3. Test backend health endpoint directly:
   ```
   https://furniture-recommendation-model-ai-3a8c-al6n6fqp6.vercel.app/api/health
   ```
